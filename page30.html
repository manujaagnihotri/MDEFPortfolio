                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)</strong>: Digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of unique items or content, often using blockchain technology to verify their uniqueness and ownership.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Blockchains</strong>: A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that is immutable, transparent, and secure. It enables the creation of NFTs and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
<br>
<br><strong>3. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)</strong>: Organizations that are governed by smart contracts and operate without centralized control. They allow participants to vote on decisions and manage resources transparently through blockchain technology, aiming for decentralized governance and decision-making.<br><br>Having lectures on these complex terms and technologies was quite eye-opening and especially to see the possibilities of intertwining communities to create safe networks. Upon understanding the very basics of blockchains and DAOs, we voted on our topics of interest areas of issues. After having our teams made, we researched slightly on our topics and found resources and references that support the topic. Our topic was -&nbsp;<strong>Unavoidable heat experience in near future for a lot of population </strong><span style="font-size: 19.2px;"><strong>centers</strong></span><strong>. </strong><a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN75_Ou4=/" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><strong>Here </strong></a>is the miro board to have an insight of the process.&nbsp;<br><br>After looking over at several resources and references, we decided to create a community that rewards its members through coins that can be in cashed for various different benefits (community dinners, grocery vouchers etc) through an app that monitors heat temperatures of the building.&nbsp; Below you can see the explanatory video and the video of the app prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    Reflection</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This past week has been a whirlwind of intensity, inundating me with a deluge of technical terms and concepts that I had previously only grazed the surface of. Initially, I found myself swimming in a sea of unfamiliar jargon and technologies, feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information being thrown my way. Yet, amidst the chaos, I came to realize the necessity of immersing myself in these complexities, understanding that they are not just ephemeral trends but essential components in shaping the landscape of future design and projects.
<br>
<br>As I grappled with the intricacies of blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), I began to appreciate the profound impact they hold within the realms of innovation and collaboration. Despite their abstract nature, delving deeper into these subjects allowed me to unearth a newfound appreciation for their potential applications and transformative power. It became evident that to remain relevant in the ever-evolving field of design, it is imperative to embrace emerging technologies and integrate them seamlessly into our creative processes.
<br>
<br>One particularly enlightening aspect of the week was the online hybrid session with professionals from Manchester, where we had the opportunity to gain insights into their perspectives and methodologies. This cross-cultural exchange not only broadened my horizons but also provided valuable real-world context to complement the theoretical knowledge I had acquired. Witnessing firsthand how blockchain technology and DAOs are implemented in different contexts shed light on their versatility and adaptability, reinforcing the notion that innovation knows no bounds.
<br>
<br>Moreover, the collaborative nature of the session underscored the importance of forging connections and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in navigating the complex terrain of modern design. By engaging with experts from diverse backgrounds and exchanging ideas, I gained invaluable insights that transcended the confines of traditional learning environments. It served as a poignant reminder that true innovation often stems from the intersection of disparate disciplines, where ideas converge and boundaries blur.
<br>
<br>Reflecting on the week's endeavors, I am filled with a sense of both apprehension and excitement. While the sheer magnitude of information may have initially seemed daunting, it has also ignited a spark of curiosity within me, propelling me to delve deeper into the intricacies of blockchain technology and its myriad applications. Armed with newfound knowledge and a broader perspective, I feel empowered to embrace the challenges that lie ahead, confident in my ability to navigate the ever-changing landscape of design with agility and foresight.
<br>
<br>In essence, this week has been a journey of discovery and growth, punctuated by moments of uncertainty and enlightenment. It has reinforced the notion that learning is a continuous process, one that requires an open mind and a willingness to embrace the unknown. As I embark on the next phase of my educational journey, I carry with me the lessons learned and the insights gained, knowing that they will serve as the foundation upon which I build my future endeavors in the dynamic world of design.</p>
